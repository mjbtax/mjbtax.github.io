This Privacy Policy sets out the principles and procedures that the company follows in meeting its privacy commitments to its clients and complying with the requirements of federal and provincial privacy legislation.
IDENTIFYING PURPOSES

LIMITING COLLECTION
The company collects only that personal information required to perform its professional services and to operate its business, and such information is collected by fair and lawful means.
The partners and staff involved in an engagement need access to some or all of the types of personal information, noted previously in this policy, to obtain evidence to support the company’s opinion on the company’s financial statements or to facilitate the completion of special projects as engaged by the client. Such personal information will be a significant component of various transactions and events affecting the financial statements that will be subjected to concompanyation, testing, analyses and such other procedures as the company considers necessary to perform an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards or a special project.
LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE & RETENTION
The company uses or discloses personal information only for purposes for which it has consent, or as required by law.
We may also disclose personal information without consent:
•	to comply with a subpoena, a warrant or an order made by a court or other body with appropriate jurisdiction or to comply with rules of conduct required by regulatory bodies. It is important to note that accounting companys are not protected by client/solicitor privileges.  
•	to a government institution that has requested the information, identified its lawful authority, and indicates that disclosure is for the purpose of enforcing, carrying out an investigation, or gathering intelligence relating to any federal, provincial or foreign law; or suspects that the information relates to national security or the conduct of international affairs; or is for the purpose of administering any federal or provincial law.
•	to an investigative body or government institution on our initiative when we believe the information concerns a breach of an agreement, or a contravention of a federal, provincial, or foreign law, or we suspect the information relates to national security or the conduct of international affairs.
As required by professional standards, rules of professional conduct and regulation, the company documents the work it performs in records, commonly called “working paper” files. Such files may include personal information obtained from a client. Working papers are safeguarded against inappropriate access, as discussed below in this policy.
We also use it to enable us to provide you through various channels with information that we believe are of interest to you. This includes such matters as:
•	new services we provide, 
•	conferences and other professional development courses we hold, 
•	notice of changes in the law or accounting practices that may be of interest to you, and 
•	other professional or business developments. 
If you do not wish to receive such information, you may opt out by sending an email to info@mjbtax.ca or by advising your primary client contact and we will discontinue sending you information other than in regard to your account.
The company retains personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill its purposes.
Working paper files and other files containing, for example, copies of personal tax returns are retained for the time period required by law and regulation or for the time period as specified in the company’s retention of client information policy.
The company regularly and systematically destroys, erases, or makes anonymous personal information no longer required to fulfill the identified collection purposes, and no longer required by laws and regulations.
The personal information collected from a client during the course of a professional service engagement may be:
•	shared with the company’s personnel participating in such engagement; 
•	disclosed to partners and team members within the company to the extent required to assess compliance with applicable professional standards and rules of professional conduct, and the company’s policies, including providing quality control reviews of work performed; 
•	provided to members of the organization’s audit committee and board of directors, and others in the company that might not otherwise have access to the information, in the course of communicating aspects of the results of our audit; and 
•	provided to external professional practice inspectors (e.g., representatives of the Canadian Public Accountability Board, or a provincial institute of chartered accountants), who by law, professional regulation, or contract have the right of access to the company’s files for inspection purposes. 
ACCURACY
The company endeavours to keep accurate, complete, and up-to-date, personal information in its possession or control, to the extent required to meet the purposes for which it was collected.
Individual clients are encouraged to contact the company’s engagement partner in charge of providing service to them to update their personal information.
SAFEGUARDS
The company protects the privacy of personal information in its possession or control by using security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
Physical security (e.g., restricted access, locked rooms and filing cabinets) is maintained over personal information stored in hard copy form. Partners and employees are authorized to access personal information based on client assignment and quality control responsibilities.
Authentication is used to prevent unauthorized access to personal information stored electronically. Encryption is used to prevent unauthorized access to personal information received or sent over the Internet.
For files and other materials containing personal information entrusted to a third party service provider (e.g., a provider of paper based or electronic file storage), the company obtains appropriate assurance to afcompany that the level of protection of personal information by the third party is equivalent to that of the company.
ACCOUNTABILITY
The company is accountable for all personal information in its possession or control. This includes any personal information that the company receives directly from clients who are individuals, or indirectly, through clients that are organizations (e.g., corporations, government entities, not-for-profit organizations).
The company has:
•	established and put into effect policies and procedures aimed at properly protecting personal information; 
•	educated its partners and employees regarding its privacy policy and their role and responsibilities in keeping personal information private; and
