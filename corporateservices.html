							<h3>Incorporation (Section 85 Asset Rollover)</h3>
							<p>
									As discussed above, an entrepreneur may decide to commence business in a partnership or sole proprietorship form in order to take advantage of start-up losses. Once the business becomes profitable it is often necessary to incorporate.

									A transfer of a sole proprietorship or a partnership to a corporation takes place under section 85. Section 85 is the general rollover provision for capital assets and is used in many different types of reorganization.

									Under section 85, the disposition of property may give rise to the recognition of gain or loss by the taxpayer. The resulting tax liability may however be deferred on a transfer by a taxpayer to a corporation for consideration that includes shares issued by the transferee.
									</p>
dd
									<p>Some of the most common applications of section 85 are listed below:
									</p>

									The incorporation of a business by an individual or a partnership
									The creation of a holding company by an individual or a partnership
									The transfer of property to a corporation in the context of an estate freeze and/or income splitting reorganization
									The transfer of property within a group of corporations for business or tax reasons
									The division of a corporation under paragraph 55(3)(b)
									The purchase of property for consideration which consists in whole or in part of shares
									Section 85 of the Act does not restrict the deferral of tax liability to a specific type of transaction nor to a transaction carried out for a specific purpose. It applies to any disposition of eligible property to a taxable Canadian corporation. Common control is not required and the transfer need not be reorganizational. However, most elections under section 85 involve related parties or pertain to reorganizations, because the deferral of tax liability on the transfer of property is conditional on shares of the transferee being received as consideration by the transferor.

									Under section 85, a joint election by the transferor and the transferee has the effect of deeming the proceeds of disposition of the property to be equal to an elected amount. The same amount is deemed to be the cost of acquisition of the property. The election can thus be regarded as substituting a deemed amount for the figure determined under the income tax rules otherwise applicable to both the transferor and the transferee.

									In the case of the entrepreneur section 85 would be applicable on the transfer if the assets of the proprietorship or the partnership into the corporation in exchange for shares of this corporation. The results would be that the business originally carried on in an unincorporated form has now been acquired by the corporation on a tax deferred basis. The corporation will then continue the business.

									A formal written agreement will be entered into between the entrepreneur as vendor and the corporation as purchaser. It will have some of the normal provisions of an arm’s length agreement of purchase and sale including all necessary conveyances of title to assets.

									A detailed analysis of section 85 is beyond the scope of this paper.

									<h3>Tax Reorganizations</h3>
									<p>	
									Many reorganizations will be initiated for tax reasons, often by the company’s accountant. Tax-based reasons for reorganization include the following.
									</p>
									<p>
										Accessing corporate losses
										
								</p>
								<p>
									Crystallizing the capital gains exemption
								</p>
								<p>
									Purifying the corporation to retain its eligibility as a qualifying small business corporation for capital gains exemption purposes
									Departure of one of several shareholders
									Break up of the corporation among several shareholders
									The reorganization set out above will, for the most part, involve the utilization of one or more section 85 rollovers.
